Preliminary Product Delivery.
My project will concentrate on data visualization. Through the use of data charts, Popular running locations in San Diego will be represented. The data will be generated by user input. A user can enter a running location and Rate it with "yes" or "no" (will you go again?). After a use rates a location, the data will be represented in the Chart. I will use a barchart instead and will use a pie chart to represent "location type" such as beach, lake, public and trails. I also want to include the number of times peoplem have gonme during a month.
