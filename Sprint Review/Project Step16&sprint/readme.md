Responsive vs Adaptive design:
Responsive design is fluid compared to adaptive, it seems to naturally go with the device (screen). Adaptive use static layouts based on breakpoints which do not respond as soon as they are loaded. On my pages I used response design, if a mobile device is used, the pages will automatically be loaded to fit the mobile screen and the same goes for a desktop.

Relative Units:
Relative units are the best way to tackle pixel density. For example, when dealing images, using pixels do not adjust when viewed on a different canvas and will overtake a page. But, when using relative units and making the image 25% the image will adjust. Making a image 25% means that the image will always be at 25% no matter the canvas it is in. I used relative units because I am using an icon image for users and I need it to remain the same size on mobile and desktop devices.
Breakpoints:
Breakpoints allow for easy viewing when adjusting to mobile or when resizing the screen. When a screen is resized, breakpoints allow for the content of a page to break at a certain point to be easily viewable. I used breakpoints to make sure that the main content is always visible to matter what size the screen is.

Fonts:
Webfonts are great to use If trying to have unique fonts on your page and make the page fonts stand out. The downside is that they are downloaded from a site and will take longer to load the page. This I something I did not know and am using webfonts (google fonts) I will go back to using System fonts in order to have less lag time on my pages.
