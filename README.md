# RunApp
This is a desktop app to help locate great running areas in San Diego.
This app was created because there was a need to locate suitable running locations in San Diego. Getting exercise is something that must become part of your everyday life and not everyone has access to a gym. Going for a run is something that anyone can do and is free. The only problem that may arise is the “motivation.” This app is to encourage people to run and find their motivation by helping find a place to run depending on the persons needs, this takes away the excuse of not “knowing” where to go.
